# LogicalLens

A "logical lens" is a map: `f : Data -> ([0, 1]^n -> bool)` and is
interpreted as a family of properties over the hyper unit box, `[0,
1]^n`, indexed by "`Data`". Further, `f(data)` must be monotonic threshold
function. That is, given a fixed data `data`, the map `g = f(data)` is
such that for any two points in the unit box, `x, y in [0, 1]^n` if `x
<= y` coordinate-wise, then `g(x) <= g(y)` , where `False <= True`. An
example is given below (see
[monotone-bipartition](https://github.com/mvcisback/monotone-bipartition)
for details):

In principle, `Data` can be anything from time-series to pictures of
dogs. The key idea is that a logical lens using embedding
domain specific knowledge in the form of property tests
to design features and similarity measures.

For details on this formalism, see the following two papers or this [slide deck](https://mjvc.me/RV2018/):

In this readme, for demonstration purposes, we will be using the
`metric-temporal-logic` package. This package provides parametric
properties over time-series and can be installed with:

> $ pip install metric-temporal-logic

```python
from logical_lens import LogicalLens

x1 = .. # some arbitrary data object.
x2 = ..

# Define some logical lens. TODO
f = ..  # Data -> (Point -> bool)
lens = LogicalLens(lens=f)  # Wrapper around logical lens to add functionality.
                            # Is still callable, e.g., lens(x1) == f(x1)

p1 = (0.1, 0.1)  # Point in [0, 1]^2
p2 = (0.2, 0.3)  # Point in [0, 1]^2


# Note: forall all data, x, lens(x) must be a monotone threshold function.
assert lens(x1)(p1) <= lens(x1)(p2)  # Where in python, False <= True.


# Compute Logical Distances.
d = lens.dist(x1, x2)
A = lens.adj_matrix(data=[x1, x2, x3, x4])

# Find points on boundaries for coarse estimates.

## Find intersection of threshold surface and
## the lines intersecting the origin and the points
## provided.
f = lens.projector([(0, 1), (1, 0.3)])
Y = map(f, [x1, x2])

## Project onto 10 random lines.
f2 = lens.random_projector(10)

## Project using lexicographic ordering of parameters:
f3 = lens.lex_projector(orders=[
   [(1, False), (0, True)],  # minimizing on axis 1 then maximizing on axis 0.
   [(0, False), (1, False)],  # minimizing on axis 0 then minimizing on axis 1.
])

```
